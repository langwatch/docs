1. Create a new workflow or open an existing one
2. Drag a signature node onto the workspace
3. Click on the node to access configuration options in the right side panel
4. Make your desired changes to the prompt configuration
5. Save your changes as a new version


### Managing Prompt Versions

Once you've created a prompt version, you can:

- Restore previous versions by clicking the time icon

The Prompt Management table provides a centralized location to manage all your prompts:

1. Access the prompt table from the main menu
2. Create new prompts or edit existing ones
3. Save different versions of your prompts
4. View all saved versions in a list format
5. See who created each version (team collaboration)

All prompts and their versions are shared across your project team:

- Any prompt created in the table is available in the studio
- Changes made in the studio are reflected in the prompt table
- Team members can see who created each version
- Prompts can be reused across different workflows
