## Intro

With the Annotations API, you can annotate traces with additional information. This is useful if you want to add additional information to a trace, such as a comment or a thumbs up/down reaction.

## Authentication

To make a call to the Annotations API, you will need to pass through your LangWatch API key in the header as `X-Auth-Token`. Your API key can be found on the setup page under settings.


#### Allowed Methods

- `GET /api/annotations` - Get a list of annotations
- `GET /api/annotations/:id` - Get a single annotation
- `DELETE /api/annotations/:id` - Delete a single annotation
- `PATCH /api/annotations/:id` - Update a single annotation
- `GET /api/annotations/trace/:id` - Get the annotations for a single trace
