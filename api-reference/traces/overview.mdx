## Intro

With the Traces API, you are able to create a public path for a trace. This is useful if you want to share a trace with a colleague.

## Authentication

To make a call to the Traces API, you will need to pass through your LangWatch API key in the header as `X-Auth-Token`. Your API key can be found on the setup page under settings.


#### Allowed Methods

- `GET /api/trace/:id` - Get trace details
- `POST /api/trace/:id/share` - Create a public path for a trace
