title: Simulation Sets

The **Simulation Sets** page is the main dashboard for all your simulations. It provides a high-level overview of each set of scenarios you have defined.

Each card represents a **Simulation Set** and displays key information:

- The total number of scenarios within the set.
- The date and time of the last run.
- The `scenarioSetId`, which is the unique identifier for the set (e.g., `default`).

From here, you can click on a set to view its detailed history of batch runs.
