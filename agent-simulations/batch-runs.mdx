title: Batch Runs
---

After selecting a Simulation Set, you'll be taken to the **Batch Runs** view. This page is your main dashboard for a specific set of scenarios.

By default, it shows a list of historical **Batch Runs** on the left and opens the most recent batch run on the right, displaying the conversation of the first scenario in that batch.

From this view, you can:

-   Quickly see the history of all batch runs for a given set.
-   Expand a batch run to see the individual scenarios and their status (passed/failed).
-   Click on an individual scenario to dive deeper into its full conversation trace and run history.
