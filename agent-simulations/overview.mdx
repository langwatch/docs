The Simulations visualizer in LangWatch provides a powerful way to inspect and analyze the results of your agent tests built with the [`scenario`](https://github.com/langwatch/scenario) library. It offers a user-friendly interface to dig into simulation runs, helping you debug your agent's behavior and collaborate with your team.

## How it Works

When you run your scenarios with the LangWatch integration enabled, the results are sent to the LangWatch platform and become available in the Simulations section.

This allows you to:

- Organize your simulations into **Sets** for better management.
- View a **history of runs** for each set.
- Drill down into individual **scenario runs** to see the full conversation.
- Visualize **passing and failing** scenarios in a clear grid view.

This documentation will guide you through the different parts of the Simulations visualizer and how to make the most of them.

For technical details on the API, see the [Scenario Event Reference](/api-reference/scenarios/overview).
