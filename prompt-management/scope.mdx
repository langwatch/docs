description: "Understand how prompt scope affects access, sharing, and collaboration across projects and organizations"
---

Scope determines where your prompts are accessible and how they can be shared across your LangWatch projects and organization. Understanding scope is crucial for effective prompt management and team collaboration.

## Overview

Every prompt in LangWatch has a **scope** that defines its visibility and accessibility:

- **PROJECT scope** - Prompts accessible only within a single project
- **ORGANIZATION scope** - Prompts shared across all projects in your organization

## Project Scope (Default)

**Project scope** is the default setting for all new prompts. Prompts with project scope **are**:

- **Isolated** to a single project
- **Private** to project members only
- **Independent** from other projects
- **Fully controlled** by the project team

### Example: Project-Scoped Prompt

```json
{
  "id": "prompt_abc123",
  "handle": "internal-chatbot",
  "scope": "PROJECT",
  "projectId": "proj_456",
  "organizationId": null
}
```

This prompt is only accessible within `proj_456` and cannot be seen or used by other projects.

## Organization Scope

**Organization scope** makes prompts available across all projects in your organization. Organization-scoped prompts are:

- **Shared** across all organization projects
- **Collaborative** for cross-project teams

### When to Use Organization Scope

- **Brand guidelines** and company voice
- **Legal compliance** prompts (privacy policies, terms of service)
- **Common workflows** used across multiple projects
- **Shared knowledge** and best practices
- **Standard operating procedures**

### Example: Organization-Scoped Prompt

```json
{
  "id": "prompt_def789",
  "handle": "company-brand-voice",
  "scope": "ORGANIZATION",
  "projectId": "proj_456",
  "organizationId": "org_123"
}
```

This prompt is accessible to all projects within `org_123` but can only be modified by the original project (`proj_456`).

### Changing Prompt Scope

<Warning>
A prompt handle that is unique within a project might not be unique across projects in an organization.
When you change the scope of a prompt, you might need to change the handle to avoid conflicts.
</Warning>

To change prompt scope:

1. **Navigate** to the prompt in Prompt Management
2. **Click** the scope dropdown
3. **Select** the new scope
4. **Confirm** the change
5. **Save** the prompt

<Note>
Only prompt owners can change scope.
