Linking prompts to traces enables tracking of metrics and evaluations per prompt version. It's the foundation of improving prompt quality over time.

After linking prompts and traces, you will see information about the prompt in the trace's metadata.

For more information about traces and spans, see the [Concepts](/concepts) guide.

## How to Link Prompts to Traces

When you use `langwatch.prompt.get_prompt()` within a trace context, LangWatch automatically links the prompt to the trace:

```python
import langwatch
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize LangWatch
langwatch.setup()

@langwatch.trace()
def customer_support_generation():
    # Get prompt (automatically linked to trace when API key is present)
    prompt = langwatch.prompt.get_prompt("customer-support-bot")

    # Format messages with variables
    messages = prompt.format_messages(
        user_name="John Doe",
        user_email="john.doe@example.com",
        input="I need help with my account"
    )

    # Use with OpenAI client
    client = OpenAI()
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=prompt.model.split("openai/")[1],
        messages=messages
    )

    return completion.choices[0].message.content

# Call the function
result = customer_support_generation()
```

For more detailed information about setting up tracing in your Python application, see the [Python Integration Guide](/integration/python/guide).
