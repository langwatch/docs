# Prompt Version Control

LangWatch provides a robust version control system for managing your prompts. Each prompt can have multiple versions, allowing you to track changes, experiment with different approaches, and rollback when needed.

## Version Management

Every prompt in LangWatch automatically maintains a version history. When you create a new prompt, it starts with version 1, and each subsequent change creates a new version with an incremented number.

## Managing Versions

<Tabs>
<Tab title="UI">

Use the LangWatch UI to manage prompt versions:

1. Navigate to the **Prompt Management** section
2. Select a prompt to view its version history
3. Click on any version to see the full configuration
4. Use the version selector to switch between versions
5. Create new versions by making changes and saving

</Frame>

</Tab>
<Tab title="REST API">

Use the REST API to manage prompt versions:

```bash
# Get all versions of a prompt
curl -X GET "https://app.langwatch.ai/api/prompts/{prompt_id}/versions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key"

# Get a specific prompt (latest version)
curl -X GET "https://app.langwatch.ai/api/prompts/{prompt_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key"

# Create a new version
curl -X POST "https://app.langwatch.ai/api/prompts/{prompt_id}/versions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "configData": {
      "version": 2,
      "prompt": "Updated prompt text...",
      "messages": [...],
      "inputs": [...],
      "outputs": [...],
      "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
    },
    "commitMessage": "Improved customer support prompt"
  }'
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Version Information

Each prompt version includes metadata such as version number, commit message, author, and creation timestamp. For detailed information about the version structure and data model, see the [Data Model](/prompt-management/data-model) page.

## Version History

LangWatch provides a clear view of how your prompts have evolved over time:

</Frame>

### Viewing Version History

1. **Version List**: See all versions with timestamps and commit messages
2. **Commit Messages**: Understand what was changed in each version
3. **Author Information**: See who made each change
4. **Version Selection**: Switch between different versions to view their content

## Rollbacks

You can easily rollback to previous versions:

1. Navigate to the prompt's version history
2. Select the version you want to restore
3. Create a new version based on the selected version
4. The new version will include the restored content

## Team Collaboration

All prompt versions are shared across your project team. For organization-scoped prompts, versions are also shared across all projects in the organization.
