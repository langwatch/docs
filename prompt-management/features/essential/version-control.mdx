# Prompt Version Control

LangWatch provides a robust version control system for managing your prompts. Each prompt can have multiple versions, allowing you to track changes, experiment with different approaches, and rollback when needed.

## Version Management

Every prompt in LangWatch automatically maintains a version history. When you create a new prompt, it starts with version 1, and each subsequent change creates a new version with an incremented number.

## Managing Versions

<Tabs>
<Tab title="UI">

Use the LangWatch UI to manage prompt versions:

1. Navigate to the **Prompt Management** section
2. Select a prompt
3. Click on the version history icon at the bottom of the prompt editor
4. Use the version selector to switch between versions
5. Create new versions by making changes and saving


</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript SDK">

LangWatch's TypeScript SDK supports retrieving prompts and specific versions:

```typescript
import { getPrompt, getPromptVersion, setupLangWatch } from "langwatch";

// Initialize LangWatch for tracing and related features
await setupLangWatch();

// Get a specific prompt (latest version by default)
const prompt = await getPrompt("customer-support-bot");

// The prompt object contains version information
console.log(`Version: ${prompt.version}`);
console.log(`Version ID: ${prompt.versionId}`);

// Get a specific version of a prompt
const specificVersion = await getPromptVersion(
  "customer-support-bot",
  "version_abc123"
);

// Compile with variables
const compiledPrompt = specificVersion.compile({
  user_name: "John Doe",
  user_email: "john.doe@example.com",
  input: "I need help with my account",
});
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="REST API">

Use the REST API to manage prompt versions:

```bash
# Get all versions of a prompt
curl -X GET "https://app.langwatch.ai/api/prompts/{prompt_id}/versions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key"

# Get a specific prompt (latest version)
curl -X GET "https://app.langwatch.ai/api/prompts/{prompt_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key"

# Create a new version
curl -X POST "https://app.langwatch.ai/api/prompts/{prompt_id}/versions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "configData": {
      "version": 2,
      "prompt": "Updated prompt text...",
      "messages": [...],
      "inputs": [...],
      "outputs": [...],
      "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
    },
    "commitMessage": "Improved customer support prompt"
  }'
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Version History

LangWatch provides a clear view of how your prompts have evolved over time:

  />
</Frame>


- **Version List**: See all versions with timestamps and commit messages
- **Commit Messages**: Understand what was changed in each version
- **Author Information**: See who made each change
- **Version Selection**: Switch between different versions to view their content

## Version Information

Each prompt version includes metadata such as version number, commit message, author, and creation timestamp. For detailed information about the version structure and data model, see the [Data Model](/prompt-management/data-model) page.

## Rollbacks

You can easily rollback to previous versions:

1. Navigate to the prompt's version history
2. Select the version you want to restore
3. Create a new version based on the selected version
4. The new version will include the restored content

## Team Collaboration

All prompt versions are shared across your project team. For organization-scoped prompts, versions are also shared across all projects in the organization.

### Collaboration Features

- **Shared Access**: All team members can view all versions
- **Author Tracking**: See who created each version
- **Cross-Project Sharing**: Organization-scoped prompts are shared across projects
- **Version Comments**: Add commit messages to explain changes

For more information about prompt scoping and sharing, see the [Data Model](/prompt-management/data-model#prompt-versions) page.
