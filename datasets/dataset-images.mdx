With the your images column type set to type set to `image (URL)`, you will be able to view images in your dataset. This is useful to analyze the images at a glance.

Below is an example of on how to set the column type to `image (URL)` in the screenshot below, you can also set this type when creating a new dataset.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <Frame caption="Add Trigger" style={{ maxWidth: "300px" }}>
    <img
      className="block"
      src="/images/dataset-image-select.png"
      alt="LangWatch"
    />
  </Frame>
</div>

Once you select the image type, the dataset will be updated to show the image column. You will be able to edit the column value by clicking on the image cell. Keep in mind the column value will be the URL of the image.

<Frame  caption="Dataset image preview">
<img className="block" src="/images/dataset-image-preview.png" alt="LangWatch"  />
</Frame>
