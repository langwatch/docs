title: Automatically build datasets from real-time traces
description: Continuously populate your datasets with comming data from production
---

You can keep continously populating the dataset with new data arriving from production by using **Triggers**, mapping trace fields to any dataset columns you prefer.

Simply go to the Messages page and select a filter (for example, by model), the Add Trigger button will be enabled:

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
  <Frame caption="Add Trigger" style={{ maxWidth: "300px" }}>
    <img
      className="block"
      src="/images/add-trigger.png"
      alt="LangWatch"
    />
  </Frame>
</div>
For Action, select **Add To Dataset**, and chose the right fields to map from the trace to the dataset:

<Frame caption="Add To Dataset">
<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/add-to-dataset-trigger.png"
  alt="LangWatch"
/>
</Frame>
Hit save, and that's it! Now every time a new message matches the filter, the trigger will be fired and the dataset will be populated with the new row.
