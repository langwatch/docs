title: Individual Run View

The **Individual Run View** is where you can perform a detailed analysis of a single scenario. You can access this view by clicking on a scenario from the **Batch Runs** page.

This page displays the full conversation log between the user and the agent.

A key feature of this page is the **Previous Runs** panel on the right. It shows the history for that specific scenario, identified by its `scenarioId`, allowing you to see how its behavior has changed over time across different batches. This is invaluable for tracking regressions or improvements.

### Test Report

At the bottom of the conversation, you'll find the **Scenario Test Report**. This block provides a summary of the scenario's execution and its final outcome.

The report includes:
- **Status**: The final result of the run (e.g., PASSED, FAILED).
- **Success Criteria**: The total number of criteria that were met.
- **Duration**: The total time the scenario took to execute.
- **Met Criteria**: A list of the specific evaluation criteria that were satisfied.
- **Reasoning**: The explanation provided by the Judge Agent for its final verdict.
