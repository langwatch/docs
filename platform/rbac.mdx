LangWatch provides role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access levels. This allows you to control who can access your LangWatch workspace and what they can do.

# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

LangWatch implements a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system that manages permissions across organizations, teams, and projects. This system provides fine-grained control over what users can access and modify within the platform.

## Permission Structure

### Actions
The system defines six core actions that can be performed on resources:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `view` | Read-only access to view resources |
| `create` | Ability to create new resources |
| `update` | Ability to modify existing resources |
| `delete` | Ability to remove resources |
| `manage` | Full CRUD access plus administrative settings |
| `share` | Ability to share resources with others |

### Resources
Permissions are applied to the following resource types:

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `organization` | Organization-level settings and management |
| `project` | Individual projects within teams |
| `team` | Team management and settings |
| `analytics` | Analytics dashboards and reports |
| `cost` | Cost tracking and billing information |
| `traces` | LLM trace data and logs |
| `scenarios` | Test scenarios and evaluations |
| `annotations` | Data annotations and labeling |
| `evaluations` | Creating and managing evaluations |
| `datasets` | Managing datasets |
| `triggers` | Creating and managing triggers |
| `workflows` | Creating and managing workflows |
| `prompts` | Creating and managing prompts |


## Predefined Roles

### Team Roles

#### Admin
Full administrative access to all team resources and settings.

| Resource | Permissions |
|----------|-------------|
| Projects | `view`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `manage` |
| Analytics | `view`, `manage` |
| Cost | `view` |
| Traces | `view`, `share` |
| Annotations | `view`, `manage` |
| Evaluations | `view`, `manage` |
| Datasets | `view`, `manage` |
| Triggers | `view`, `manage` |
| Workflows | `view`, `manage` |
| Prompts | `view`, `manage` |
| Scenarios | `view`, `manage` |
| Team | `view`, `manage` |

#### Member
Same permissions as Admin but cannot manage team settings.

#### Viewer
Read-only access to most resources for observation and reporting purposes.

| Resource | Permissions |
|----------|-------------|
| Projects | `view` |
| Analytics | `view` |
| Traces | `view` |
| Annotations | `view` |
| Evaluations | `view` |
| Datasets | `view` |
| Triggers | `view` |
| Workflows | `view` |
| Prompts | `view` |
| Scenarios | `view` |
| Team | `view` |

### Organization Roles

#### Admin
Complete control over organization settings and all teams.

| Resource | Permissions |
|----------|-------------|
| Organization | `view`, `manage`, `delete` |

#### Member
Basic organization access for team members.

| Resource | Permissions |
|----------|-------------|
| Organization | `view` |

## Permission Hierarchy

The system implements a hierarchical permission model where:

- **`manage` permissions automatically include** `view`, `create`, `update`, and `delete` permissions
- This means if a user has `analytics:manage`, they automatically have `analytics:view`, `analytics:create`, `analytics:update`, and `analytics:delete`

## Custom Roles

### Overview
Organizations can create custom roles to provide more granular permission control beyond the predefined roles. Custom roles allow organizations to:

- Define specific permission combinations
- Create roles tailored to specific job functions
- Implement least-privilege access principles
- Maintain compliance with organizational policies

### Creating Custom Roles

Custom roles are created at the organization level and can be assigned to users within any team in that organization. Custome toles can be found under settings.

#### Required Fields
- **Name**: Unique role name (1-50 characters)
- **Description**: Optional description of the role's purpose
- **Permissions**: Array of specific permissions


The following screenshot shows the roles interface in LangWatch.

To create a new role, click the "Create Role" button.

Add the name and description of the role and click the "Create" button.

Once the role is created, you can attach it to a user under the teams page.

### Custom Role Management

#### Permissions Required
- **Create/Update/Delete Custom Roles**: `organization:manage` permission
- **Assign Custom Roles**: `team:manage` permission

#### Best Practices
- **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the role's purpose
- **Documentation**: Provide clear descriptions explaining when to use each role
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review custom roles to ensure they're still needed
- **Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum permissions required for the role's function
- **Testing**: Test custom roles in a development environment before deploying

### Custom Role Limitations

- Custom roles cannot grant permissions that exceed the organization admin's capabilities
- Custom roles are organization-scoped and cannot be shared across organizations
- Users can only have one custom role assignment per team
- Custom roles cannot be assigned to organization-level users (only team members)

### Demo Project Access
Special handling exists for demo projects, allowing read-only access to certain permissions without authentication for demonstration purposes.

### Public Sharing
The system supports public sharing of traces and threads, allowing access without authentication when resources are explicitly shared publicly.

## Security Considerations

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review role assignments and permissions
- **Separation of Duties**: Use different roles for different functions
- **Access Reviews**: Implement regular access reviews for sensitive roles
- **Monitoring**: Track permission usage and changes for security auditing

This RBAC system provides the flexibility to implement complex organizational structures while maintaining security and ease of management.
