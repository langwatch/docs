# Single Sign-On (SSO)

LangWatch supports sign-in via various SSO providers. There are two ways to set up SSO:

1. **Self-Hosted Deployment**: You can use any SSO provider that is supported by NextAuth.js. See the [NextAuth.js documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/providers) for the full list of supported providers.

2. **Managed Service (app.langwatch.ai)**: We currently support the following SSO providers:
