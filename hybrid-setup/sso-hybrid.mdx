# Hybrid SSO Setup: Registering an Application in Azure AD

This guide walks you through registering LangWatch as an application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to enable hybrid SSO authentication.

---

## Step 1: Access the Azure Portal

1. Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. In the left sidebar, go to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.

---

## Step 2: Register a New Application

1. Click **+ New registration**.
2. Fill out the registration form:
   - **Name**: `YourApp-SSO`
   - **Supported account types**:
     - Select **Single tenant** if the app is only used within your organization.
     - Select **Multi-tenant** if the app will be used by multiple organizations.
   - **Redirect URI**:
     - **Type**: Web  
     - **URI**: `https://langwatch.eu.auth0.com/login/callback`  
       *(Replace with your actual Auth0 domain if different)*

3. Click **Register**.

---

## Step 3: Record Important Information

After registration, copy the following values for later use:

- **Application (Client) ID**
- **Directory (Tenant) ID**

You will need these when configuring the connection in Auth0.

---

## Step 4: Create a Client Secret

1. In the left-hand menu of your registered app, click **Certificates & secrets**.
2. Under **Client secrets**, click **+ New client secret**.
3. Add a description (e.g., `LangWatch Secret`) and set an expiration period.
4. Click **Add**.
5. **Copy the value immediately** â€” it will be hidden after you leave the page.
