In this cookbook, we'll explore the differences between pure vector search and hybrid search approaches that combine vector embeddings with metadata filtering. We'll see how structured metadata can dramatically improve search relevance and precision beyond what vector similarity alone can achieve.

When users search for products, documents, or other content, they often have specific attributes in mind. For example, a shopper might want "red dresses for summer occasions" or a researcher might need "papers on climate change published after 2020." Pure semantic search might miss these nuances, but metadata filtering allows you to combine the power of vector search with explicit attribute filtering.

Like always, we'll focus on data-driven approaches to measure and improve retrieval performance.

## Requirements

Before starting, ensure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install langwatch lancedb datasets openai tqdm pandas pyarrow tantivy pylance
```

## Setup

Start by setting up the environment:

```python
import getpass
import lancedb
import openai
from datasets import load_dataset
import langwatch

openai.api_key = getpass.getpass('Enter your OpenAI API key: ')
langwatch.login()
db = lancedb.connect('./lancedb_ecommerce_demo')
```

## The Dataset

In this cookbook, we'll work with a product catalog dataset containing fashion items with structured metadata. The dataset includes:

- **Basic product information**: titles, descriptions, brands, and prices
- **Categorization**: categories, subcategories, and product types
- **Attributes**: structured characteristics like sleeve length, neckline, and fit
- **Materials and patterns**: fabric types and design patterns

Here's what our taxonomy structure looks like:

```json
{
  "taxonomy_map": {
    "Women": {
      "Tops": {
        "product_type": [
          "T-Shirts",
          "Blouses",
          "Sweaters",
          "Cardigans",
          "Tank Tops",
          "Hoodies",
          "Sweatshirts"
        ],
        "attributes": {
          "Sleeve Length": [
            "Sleeveless",
            "Short Sleeve",
            "3/4 Sleeve",
            "Long Sleeve"
          ],
          "Neckline": [
            "Crew Neck",
            "V-Neck",
            "Turtleneck",
            "Scoop Neck",
            "Cowl Neck"
          ],
          "Fit": ["Regular", "Slim", "Oversized", "Cropped"]
        }
      },
      "Bottoms": {
        "product_type": ["Pants", "Jeans", "Shorts", "Skirts", "Leggings"],
        "attributes": {
          // Additional attributes...
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Having well-structured metadata enables more precise filtering and can significantly improve search relevance, especially for domain-specific applications where users have particular attributes in mind. This data might come from manual tagging by product managers or automated processes with LLMs.

Let's first load the dataset from Huggingface:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

labelled_dataset = load_dataset("ivanleomk/labelled-ecommerce-taxonomy")["train"]
```

## Prepare DataFrame for LanceDB

We'll use a Pandas DataFrame as the ingest interface.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(labelled_dataset)
df["id"] = df["id"].astype(str)
```

For simplicity, use `description` as the "text" field, although you could concatenate title/description/etc.

## Generate Embeddings (OpenAI)

Now, let's create embeddings for our product descriptions. We'll use OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model:

```python
import numpy as np
from tqdm import tqdm

def batch_embed(texts, model="text-embedding-3-large"):
    batch_size = 100
    embeddings = []
    for i in tqdm(range(0, len(texts), batch_size), desc="Embedding..."):
        batch = texts[i:i+batch_size]
        response = openai.embeddings.create(model=model, input=batch)
        emb = [np.array(e.embedding, dtype='float32') for e in response.data]
        embeddings.extend(emb)
    return embeddings

df["embedding"] = batch_embed(df["description"].tolist())
```

## Combine all text fields into a single searchable text field

We'll create a single text field that combines the product name, description, and category. This will allow us to perform a single search over all relevant text content:

```python
df["searchable_text"] = df.apply(
    lambda row: " ".join([
        row["title"],
        row["description"],
        row["brand"],
        row["category"],
        row["subcategory"],
        row["product_type"],
        row["attributes"],
        row["material"],
        row["pattern"],
        row["occasions"],
    ]),
    axis=1
)
df["searchable_text"].head()
```

## Ingest Data into LanceDB

We'll use LanceDB to store our product data and embeddings. LanceDB makes it easy to experiment, as it provides both vector and hybrid search capabilities within one single API.

```python
import pyarrow as pa

table_schema = pa.schema(
    [
        pa.field("id", pa.string()),
        pa.field("description", pa.string()),
        pa.field("title", pa.string()),
        pa.field("brand", pa.string()),
        pa.field("category", pa.string()),
        pa.field("subcategory", pa.string()),
        pa.field("product_type", pa.string()),
        pa.field("attributes", pa.string()),
        pa.field("material", pa.string()),
        pa.field("pattern", pa.string()),
        pa.field("price", pa.float64()),
        pa.field("occasions", pa.string()),
        pa.field(
            "embedding", pa.list_(pa.float32(), 3072)
        ),  # size depends on your model!!
        pa.field("searchable_text", pa.string()),
    ]
)

# Drop unused columns
df_ = df.drop(columns=["image"])

# Create table + upload data
if "products" in db.table_names():
    tbl = db.open_table("products")
else:
    tbl = db.create_table("products", data=df_, schema=table_schema, mode="overwrite")

tbl.create_fts_index("searchable_text", replace=True)
```

## Generating Synthetic Data

When you don't have production data to start with, you can generate synthetic data to simulate a real-world scenario. We already have the 'output', which is the clothing item we just embedded. We now want to generate synthetic queries that would be relevant to the clothing item.

In this case, we'll use GPT-5 to generate realistic user queries that would naturally lead to each product in our catalog. This gives us query-product pairs where we know the ground truth relevance.

```python
import random
from openai import OpenAI
from tqdm import tqdm

# Initialize OpenAI client
client = OpenAI(api_key=openai.api_key)

# Define query types to generate variety
query_types = [
    "Basic search for specific item",
    "Search with price constraint",
    "Search for specific occasion",
    "Search with material preference",
    "Search with style/attribute preference"
]

def generate_synthetic_query(item):
    """Generate a realistic search query for a clothing item"""

    # Select a random query type
    query_type = random.choice(query_types)

    # Create prompt for the LLM
    prompt = f"""
    Generate a realistic search query that would lead someone to find this specific clothing item:

    Item Details:
    - Title: {item["title"]}
    - Description: {item["description"]}
    - Category: {item["category"]}
    - Subcategory: {item["subcategory"]}
    - Product Type: {item["product_type"]}
    - Price: ${item["price"]}
    - Material: {item["material"]}
    - Attributes: {item["attributes"]}
    - Occasions: {item["occasions"]}

    The query should be in a conversational tone, about 10-20 words, and focus on a {query_type.lower()}.
    Don't mention the exact product name, but include specific details that would make this item a perfect match.

    Example: For a $120 silk blouse with long sleeves, a query might be:
    "Looking for an elegant silk top with long sleeves for work, under $150"
    """

    # Generate query using OpenAI
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that generates realistic shopping queries."},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ]
    )

    # Extract the generated query
    query = response.choices[0].message.content.strip().strip('"')

    return {"query": query, **item}

# Generate queries
synthetic_queries = []
for item in tqdm(labelled_dataset, desc="Generating queries"):
    query_data = generate_synthetic_query(item)
    synthetic_queries.append(query_data)
```

Let's visualize what this looks like:

```python
from rich import print

print(synthetic_queries[0])
```

```json
{
    'query': 'Searching for a sleeveless top with lace detailing at the neckline for casual outings and dinner
dates.',
    'image': <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=768x1024 at 0x13E0BB230>,
    'title': 'Lace Detail Sleeveless Top',
    'brand': 'H&M',
    'description': "Elevate your casual wardrobe with this elegant sleeveless top featuring intricate lace
detailing at the neckline. Perfect for both day and night, it's crafted from a soft, breathable fabric for all-day
comfort.",
    'category': 'Women',
    'subcategory': 'Tops',
    'product_type': 'Tank Tops',
    'attributes': '[{"name": "Sleeve Length", "value": "Sleeveless"}, {"name": "Neckline", "value": "Crew Neck"}]',
    'material': 'Cotton',
    'pattern': 'Solid',
    'id': 1,
    'price': 181.04,
    'occasions': '["Everyday Wear", "Casual Outings", "Smart Casual", "Dinner Dates", "Partywear"]'
}
```

## **Hybrid Search in LanceDB**

LanceDB makes it easy to combine vector search with full-text search in a single query. Let's see how this works with a practical example:

```python
text_query = "dress for wedding guests"
vector_query = openai.embeddings.create(model="text-embedding-3-large", input=text_query).data[0].embedding

results = tbl.search(query_type="hybrid") \
    .text(text_query) \
    .vector(vector_query) \
    .limit(5) \
    .to_pandas()
```

| title                                   | brand     | description                                                           | category | subcategory | product_type     | price  | \_relevance_score |
| --------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| Elegant Wedding Guest Dress             | Zara      | A stunning formal dress perfect for wedding ceremonies and receptions | Women    | Dresses     | Formal Dresses   | 189.99 | 0.87              |
| Floral Maxi Dress for Special Occasions | H&M       | Beautiful floral pattern dress ideal for weddings and formal events   | Women    | Dresses     | Maxi Dresses     | 149.50 | 0.82              |
| Satin Wedding Guest Jumpsuit            | ASOS      | Sophisticated alternative to dresses for wedding guests               | Women    | Jumpsuits   | Formal Jumpsuits | 165.75 | 0.79              |
| Men's Formal Wedding Suit               | Hugo Boss | Classic tailored suit perfect for wedding guests                      | Men      | Suits       | Formal Suits     | 399.99 | 0.71              |
| Beaded Evening Gown                     | Nordstrom | Elegant floor-length gown with beaded details for formal occasions    | Women    | Dresses     | Evening Gowns    | 275.00 | 0.68              |

## Implementing Different Search Methods

To properly compare different search approaches, we'll implement three search functions:

```python
import re

def sanitize_query(query):
    # Remove characters that break LanceDB FTS queries
    return re.sub(r"['\"\\]", "", query)

def search_semantic(tbl, query, embedding, k=5):
    return tbl.search(embedding).limit(k).to_pandas()["id"].tolist()

def search_lexical(tbl, query, k=5):
    # BM25 over description field
    return tbl.search(query=sanitize_query(query), query_type="fts").limit(k).to_pandas()["id"].tolist()

def search_hybrid(tbl, query, embedding, k=5):
    # Blends vector and BM25
    return tbl.search(query_type="hybrid").text(sanitize_query(query)).vector(embedding).limit(k).to_pandas()["id"].tolist()
```

These functions provide a clean interface for our three search methods:

- **Semantic search**: Uses only vector embeddings to find similar products
- **Lexical search**: Uses only BM25 text matching (similar to what traditional search engines use)
- **Hybrid search**: Combines both approaches for potentially better results

Note that we sanitize the query text to remove characters that might break the full-text search functionality. This is an important preprocessing step when working with user-generated queries.

## Evaluation Metrics

To objectively compare our search methods, we'll use two standard information retrieval metrics:

1. **Recall**: The proportion of relevant items successfully retrieved
2. **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: How high relevant items appear in our results

```python
def recall(retrieved, expected):
    return float(len(set(retrieved).intersection(set(expected)))) / len(expected)

def mrr(retrieved, expected):
    # expected: list of relevant document ids (strings)
    for rank, doc_id in enumerate(retrieved, 1):
        if doc_id in expected:
            return 1.0 / rank
    return 0.0

def evaluate_search(tbl, queries, expected_ids, embeddings, k=5):
    # Initialize a new LangWatch evaluation experiment
    evaluation = langwatch.evaluation.init("search-methods-comparison")

    metrics = dict(semantic=[], lexical=[], hybrid=[])

    # Use evaluation.loop() to track the iteration
    for idx, query in evaluation.loop(enumerate(tqdm(queries, desc="Evaluating..."))):
        eid = expected_ids[idx]
        emb = embeddings[idx]

        # Semantic search
        semantic_results = search_semantic(tbl, query, emb, k)
        semantic_recall = recall(semantic_results, eid)
        semantic_mrr = mrr(semantic_results, eid)

        # Log semantic search results to LangWatch
        evaluation.log(
            "semantic_search",
            index=idx,
            score=semantic_recall,  # Using recall as the primary score
            data={
                "query": query,
                "expected_id": eid,
                "retrieved_ids": semantic_results,
                "recall": semantic_recall,
                "mrr": semantic_mrr,
                "k": k
            }
        )

        metrics["semantic"].append({
            "recall": semantic_recall,
            "mrr": semantic_mrr
        })

        # Lexical search
        lexical_results = search_lexical(tbl, query, k)
        lexical_recall = recall(lexical_results, eid)
        lexical_mrr = mrr(lexical_results, eid)

        # Log lexical search results to LangWatch
        evaluation.log(
            "lexical_search",
            index=idx,
            score=lexical_recall,
            data={
                "query": query,
                "expected_id": eid,
                "retrieved_ids": lexical_results,
                "recall": lexical_recall,
                "mrr": lexical_mrr,
                "k": k
            }
        )

        metrics["lexical"].append({
            "recall": lexical_recall,
            "mrr": lexical_mrr
        })

        # Hybrid search
        hybrid_results = search_hybrid(tbl, query, emb, k)
        hybrid_recall = recall(hybrid_results, eid)
        hybrid_mrr = mrr(hybrid_results, eid)

        # Log hybrid search results to LangWatch
        evaluation.log(
            "hybrid_search",
            index=idx,
            score=hybrid_recall,
            data={
                "query": query,
                "expected_id": eid,
                "retrieved_ids": hybrid_results,
                "recall": hybrid_recall,
                "mrr": hybrid_mrr,
                "k": k
            }
        )

        metrics["hybrid"].append({
            "recall": hybrid_recall,
            "mrr": hybrid_mrr
        })

    return metrics
```

The evaluate_search function runs all three search methods on each query and calculates both metrics. This gives us a nice view of how each method performs across our test set.

## **Prepare Evaluation Data**

Assuming your **synthetic queries** are a list of dicts with `"query"` and `"id"`.

```python
queries = [item["query"] for item in synthetic_queries]
expected_ids = [[str(item["id"])] for item in synthetic_queries]
query_embeddings = batch_embed(queries)  # for fair test, encode queries w/same embedding model
```

## Run the Experiment

Now we can run the experiments. The code does the following:

1. Tests each search method with different numbers of results (k=3, 5, and 10)
2. Aggregates the metrics by calculating the mean recall and MRR for each method
3. Organizes the results in a DataFrame for easy comparison

```python
k_values = [3, 5, 10]
results = []

# Initialize a new LangWatch evaluation for the overall comparison
comparison_eval = langwatch.evaluation.init("search-methods-comparison-summary")

for k in k_values:
    metrics = evaluate_search(tbl, queries, expected_ids, query_embeddings, k=k)
    import numpy as np

    def aggregate_metrics(metrics):
        return {m: {"recall": np.mean([x["recall"] for x in v]),
                    "mrr": np.mean([x["mrr"] for x in v])} for m, v in metrics.items()}

    summary = aggregate_metrics(metrics)

    # Log aggregated metrics to LangWatch
    for i, (method, vals) in enumerate(summary.items()):
        comparison_eval.log(
            f"aggregated_{method}_k{k}",
            index=i,
            score=vals["recall"],  # Using recall as the primary score
            data={
                "k": k,
                "method": method,
                "avg_recall": vals["recall"],
                "avg_mrr": vals["mrr"]
            }
        )

        results.append({"k": k, "method": method, "recall": vals["recall"], "mrr": vals["mrr"]})

results_df = pd.DataFrame(results)
print(results_df)
```

| k   | method   | recall | mrr   |
| --- | -------- | ------ | ----- |
| 3   | semantic | 0.906  | 0.816 |
| 3   | lexical  | 0.937  | 0.815 |
| 3   | hybrid   | 0.916  | 0.848 |
| 5   | semantic | 0.937  | 0.823 |
| 5   | lexical  | 0.969  | 0.822 |
| 5   | hybrid   | 0.948  | 0.860 |
| 10  | semantic | 0.974  | 0.828 |
| 10  | lexical  | 0.984  | 0.824 |
| 10  | hybrid   | 0.990  | 0.868 |

## Conclusion

Our evaluation demonstrates that hybrid search consistently outperforms both pure vector search and lexical search across all tested k values. Key findings:

- Hybrid search achieves the highest MRR scores, showing that combining semantic understanding with keyword matching places relevant results higher in the result list.
- Lexical search performs surprisingly well on recall, reminding us that traditional keyword approaches remain valuable for explicit queries.
- Vector search provides a solid baseline but benefits significantly from the precision that text matching adds.

As k increases, recall improves across all methods, but hybrid search maintains its advantage in ranking relevant items higher. These results highlight that the best search approach depends on your specific data and user query patterns. For product search where users combine concepts ("casual") with attributes ("red"), hybrid search offers clear advantages.

I hope this analysis helps you make informed decisions about the best approach for your own use case. Remember to:

1. Test multiple retrieval strategies on your specific data
2. Measure performance with appropriate metrics
3. Consider the trade-offs between implementation complexity and performance gains
