description: Build custom DSPy optimizers and track them in LangWatch
---

If you are building a custom DSPy optimizer, then LangWatch won't support tracking it out of the box, but adding track to any custom optimizer is also very simple.

## 1. Initialize LangWatch DSPy with optimizer=None

Before the compilation step, explicitly provide `None` on the `optimizer` parameter to be able to track the steps manually:

```python
langwatch.dspy.init(experiment="dspy-custom-optimizer-example", optimizer=None)

compiled_rag = my_awesome_optimizer.compile(RAG(), trainset=trainset)
```

## 2. Track the metric function

Either before instantiating your optimizer, or inside the compilation step, don't forget to wrap the metric function with `langwatch.dspy.track_metric` so that it's tracked:

```python
metric = langwatch.dspy.track_metric(metric)
```

## 3. Track each step

Now at each step your optimizer progresses, call `langwatch.dspy.log_step` to capture the score at the current step index, optimizer info and predictors being used on this step evaluation:

```python
langwatch.dspy.log_step(
    optimizer=DSPyOptimizer(
        name="MyAwesomeOptimizer",
        parameters={
            "hyperparam": 1,
        },
    ),
    index="1", # step index
    score=0.5,
    label="score",
    predictors=candidate_program.predictors(),
)
```

The LLM calls and examples being evaluated with be tracked automatically and logged in together with calling `log_step`.

## Wrapping up

That's it! You should see the steps of the optimizer in the LangWatch dashboard now.
