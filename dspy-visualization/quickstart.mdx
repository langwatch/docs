LangWatch DSPy Visualization allows you to start tracking your DSPy experiments in real-time and easily follow the progress, track costs and debug each step.

## 1. Install the Python library

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Notebook">
  ```bash
  !pip install langwatch
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Command Line">
  ```bash
  pip install langwatch
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 2. Login to LangWatch

Import and authenticate the LangWatch SDK:

```python
import langwatch

langwatch.login()
```

Be sure to login or create an account on the link that will be displayed, then provide your API key when prompted.

## 3. Start tracking

Before your DSPy program compilation starts, initialize langwatch with your experiment name and the optimizer to be tracked:

```python
# Initialize langwatch for this run, to track the optimizer compilation
langwatch.dspy.init(experiment="my-awesome-experiment", optimizer=optimizer)

compiled_rag = optimizer.compile(RAG(), trainset=trainset)
```

## Follow your experiment

Open the link provided when the compilation starts or go to your [LangWatch dashboard](https://app.langwatch.ai) to follow the progress of your experiments:

## Wrapping up

With your experiments tracked on LangWatch, now it's time to explore how is the training going, take a look at the examples, the llm calls,
the different steps and so on, so you can understand and hypothesize where you could improve your DSPy program, and keep iterating!

<Note>
When you are ready to deploy your DSPy program, you can monitor the inference traces on LangWatch dashboard as well. Check out the [Python Integration Guide](/integration/python/guide) for more details.
