# Running Scenarios

Once you've created a scenario and configured a target, you can run it to test your agent's behavior.

## Quick Run

From the Scenario Editor, click the **Run** button to execute the scenario against the configured target.

The scenario runs immediately and you'll see real-time progress as:

1. The User Simulator generates the first message based on the Situation
2. Your agent (Target) responds
3. The conversation continues until completion
4. The Judge evaluates against your Criteria

## Run Visualizer

After a run completes, the Run Visualizer shows the full conversation and evaluation results.

### Conversation View

The left panel shows the full conversation trace:

- **User messages** (blue): Generated by the User Simulator
- **Agent messages** (gray): Responses from your target
- **Tool calls** (if any): Actions taken by the agent

Click any message to see details like:
- Raw content
- Timestamp
- Token count
- Tool call arguments

### Evaluation Results

The right panel shows evaluation results:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Status** | Overall pass/fail |
| **Score** | Percentage of criteria passed |
| **Duration** | Total run time |

### Criteria Breakdown

Each criterion shows:
- **Pass/Fail** indicator
- **Reasoning** from the Judge explaining the evaluation

<Tip>
  The Judge's reasoning helps you understand exactly why a criterion passed or
  failed. Use this to refine your criteria or identify agent issues.
</Tip>

## Analyzing Failed Runs

When a scenario fails, use the Run Visualizer to diagnose the issue:

### 1. Check the Criteria Breakdown

Look at which criteria failed and read the Judge's reasoning. Common issues:

| Failed Because | Likely Issue |
|----------------|--------------|
| "Agent did not acknowledge..." | Missing empathy in responses |
| "Agent asked too many questions" | Overly verbose conversation flow |
| "Agent recommended wrong category" | Knowledge or retrieval issue |
| "Conversation ended abruptly" | Error handling or timeout |

### 2. Review the Conversation

Step through the conversation to find where things went wrong:
- Did the agent misunderstand the user's intent?
- Did the agent get stuck in a loop?
- Did an error interrupt the flow?

### 3. Check Tool Calls

If your agent uses tools, verify:
- Were the right tools called?
- Were arguments correct?
- Did tool results get used properly?

## Run History

Access past runs from the Scenario Editor by clicking **View Runs**. This shows all previous executions with:

- Timestamp
- Target used
- Pass/fail status
- Quick link to the Run Visualizer

<img src="/images/scenarios/run-history.png" alt="Run History" />

Use run history to:
- **Track progress** as you iterate on your agent
- **Compare runs** before and after changes
- **Identify regressions** when a previously passing scenario fails

## Best Practices

### Iterate on Criteria

If a scenario fails unexpectedly, consider whether the criteria are:
- **Too strict**: Requiring exact wording or behavior
- **Too vague**: Not specific enough for the Judge to evaluate
- **Conflicting**: Multiple criteria that can't all be satisfied

### Test Edge Cases

Create scenarios for:
- Happy paths (expected behavior)
- Error conditions (invalid inputs, timeouts)
- Edge cases (unusual requests, adversarial users)
- Multi-turn complexity (long conversations, topic changes)

### Use Labels for Organization

As your scenario library grows, use labels to:
- Filter to relevant scenarios quickly
- Group scenarios for batch runs (coming in M2)
- Track coverage across features
