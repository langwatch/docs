LangWatch library is the easiest way to integrate your TypeScript application with LangWatch, the messages are synced on the background so it doesn't intercept or block your LLM calls.

## Basic Concepts

- Each message triggering your LLM pipeline as a whole is captured with a [Trace](/concepts#traces).
- A [Trace](/concepts#traces) contains multiple [Spans](/concepts#spans), which are the steps inside your pipeline.
  - A span can be an LLM call, a database query for a RAG retrieval, or a simple function transformation.
  - Different types of [Spans](/concepts#spans) capture different parameters.
  - [Spans](/concepts#spans) can be nested to capture the pipeline structure.
- [Traces](/concepts#traces) can be grouped together on LangWatch Dashboard by having the same [`thread_id`](/concepts#threads) in their metadata, making the individual messages become part of a conversation.
  - It is also recommended to provide the [`user_id`](/concepts#user-id) metadata to track user analytics.
