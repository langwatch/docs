## Capture a RAG Span

Appart from LLM spans, another very used type of span is the RAG span. This is used to capture the retrieved contexts from a RAG that will be used by the LLM, and enables a whole new set of RAG-based features evaluations for RAG quality on LangWatch.

import TypeScriptRAG from "/snippets/typescript-rag.mdx";

<TypeScriptRAG />

## Capture an arbritary Span

You can also use generic spans to capture any type of operation, its inputs and outputs, for example for a function call:

import TypeScriptCaptureSpans from "/snippets/typescript-capture-spans.mdx";

<TypeScriptCaptureSpans />

## Capturing Exceptions

To capture also when your code throws an exception, you can simply wrap your code around a try/catch, and update or end the span with the exception:

import TypeScriptExceptions from "/snippets/typescript-exceptions.mdx";

<TypeScriptExceptions />

## Capturing custom evaluation results

[LangWatch Evaluators](/evaluations/evaluators/list) can run automatically on your traces, but if you have an in-house custom evaluator, you can also capture the evaluation
results of your custom evaluator on the current trace or span by using the `.addEvaluation` method:

import TypeScriptCustomEvaluation from "/snippets/typescript-custom-evaluation.mdx"

<TypeScriptCustomEvaluation />
