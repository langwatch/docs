## OnPrem SSO Setup: Azure AD

This guide walks you through registering LangWatch as an application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to enable SSO authentication.

---
### Step 1: Access the Azure Portal

1. Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. In the left sidebar, go to:
   - **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**

---

### Step 2: Register a New Application

1. Click **+ New registration**.
2. Fill out the registration form:

   - **Name**: `YourApp-SSO`
   - **Supported account types**:
     - Select **Single tenant** if the app is only used within your organization.
     - Select **Multi-tenant** if the app will be used by multiple organizations.
   - **Redirect URI**:
     - **Type**: `Web`
     - **URI**: `https://your-custom-domain.com/api/auth/callback/azure-ad`  
       *(Replace with your actual domain)*

3. Click **Register**.

---

### Step 3: Record Important Information

After registration, **copy the following values** for later use:

- **Application (Client) ID**
- **Directory (Tenant) ID**

You will need these when configuring the connection with environment variables.

---

### Step 4: Create a Client Secret

1. In the left-hand menu of your registered app, click **Certificates & secrets**.
2. Under **Client secrets**, click **+ New client secret**.
3. Add a description (e.g., `Auth0 Secret`) and set an expiration period.
4. Click **Add**.
5. **Copy the value immediately** — it will be hidden after you leave the page.

---

### Step 5: Add to `.env`

Once you have all these details, add them to your `.env` file as shown below:

```env
NEXTAUTH_PROVIDER="azure-ad"
AZURE_CLIENT_ID="***client-id***"
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET="**client-secret**"
AZURE_TENANT_ID=**tenant-id**
```

---

### Step 6: USER DB TABLE

For users who have not yet transitioned from basic authentication, one final step is required:

Set the `pendingSsoSetup` column to `TRUE` in the user database.

Once the user logs in using the new SSO flow, the system will automatically update their account to use the new method and reset the column back to `FALSE`.

✅ That’s it — you’re all set!
