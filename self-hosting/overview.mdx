## Enterprise OnPrem Solution

For organizations that require the data to never leave their own infrastructure, we offer a managed on-premise service.

If you need to manage the installation yourself for compliance reasons, you can follow our detailed deployment instructions which we will provide after an [onboarding call](https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/manouk-draisma). However, granting our team temporary access to an isolated area of your infrastructure can streamline the process, ensuring a quick and efficient setup of LangWatch on your premises.

## Hybrid Setup

We offer seamless integrations with S3-compatible storage and Elasticsearch, supporting both cloud and on-premise environments.

For hybrid deployments, you can choose between a fully managed service on your infrastructure or a self-managed setup. If you need to retain full control for compliance or security reasons, our team will provide detailed deployment instructions after a brief [onboarding call](https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/manouk-draisma). To accelerate the setup, you may optionally grant us temporary access to an isolated environment within your infrastructure.
