## Enterprise OnPrem Solution

For organizations that require the data to never leave their own infrastructure, we offer a managed on-premise service.

If you need to manage the installation yourself for compliance reasons, you can follow our detailed deployment instructions which we will provide after an [onboarding call](https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/manouk-draisma). However, granting our team temporary access to an isolated area of your infrastructure can streamline the process, ensuring a quick and efficient setup of LangWatch on your premises.

## Local Testing Environment

For testing purposes, we provide a docker-compose setup for a local testing environment that can be installed on your local machine. This allows you to test LangWatch for sensitive data without having to install it on your production environment.

**Note:** This setup is not scalable for production workloads. For production deployments, please consider our [Cloud](https://app.langwatch.ai) or [Enterprise On-Premises solution](#enterprise-on-premises-solution).

### Setup

At this moment, we are looking for feedback from our users on the docker-compose setup and understanding your use case.
