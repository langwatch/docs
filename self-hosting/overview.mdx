LangWatch is composed of a few core components:

- **LangWatch App**: The main application and user interface for the platform.
- **LangEvals**: The evaluation service for LangWatch built-in evaluators.
- **LangWatch NLP**: The service the runs workflows and custom built evaluators in the platform.
- **LangWatch Workers**: The background workers running inside the app, processing traces, triggering alerts, real-time evaluations and so on.
- **Redis**: A redis queue that coordinates and add resiliency for the traces to be processed.
- **Elasticsearch/OpenSearch**: The main database for the platform, storing traces and evaluation results.
- **PostgreSQL**: The core database for the platform, storing user accounts, teams, and other metadata.

Check out the [OnPrem](/self-hosting/onprem) page for more in-depth architecture information, and below you can find the deployment options for self-hosting LangWatch.

### Enterprise OnPrem Solution

For organizations that require the data to never leave their own infrastructure, we offer a managed on-premise service.

If you need to manage the installation yourself for compliance reasons, you can follow our detailed deployment instructions which we will provide after an [onboarding call](https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/manouk-draisma). However, granting our team temporary access to an isolated area of your infrastructure can streamline the process, ensuring a quick and efficient setup of LangWatch on your premises.

Check out the [OnPrem](/self-hosting/onprem) page for more details.

### Hybrid Setup

We offer seamless integrations with S3-compatible storage and Elasticsearch, supporting both cloud and on-premise environments.

For hybrid deployments, you can choose between a fully managed service on your infrastructure or a self-managed setup. If you need to retain full control for compliance or security reasons, our team will provide detailed deployment instructions after a brief [onboarding call](https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/manouk-draisma). To accelerate the setup, you may optionally grant us temporary access to an isolated environment within your infrastructure.

Check out the [Hybrid Setup](/hybrid-setup/overview) page for more details.

### Docker Compose

For the open-source version, LangWatch is available as a Docker Compose setup for easy deployment on your local machine.

Check out the [Docker Compose](/self-hosting/docker-compose) page for more details.

### Helm Chart

LangWatch open-source is also available as a Helm chart for easy deployment on Kubernetes.
