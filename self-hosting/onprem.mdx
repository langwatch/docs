## Local Testing Environment

For testing purposes, we provide a docker-compose setup for a local testing environment that can be installed on your local machine. This allows you to test LangWatch for sensitive data without having to install it on your production environment.

**Note:** This setup is not scalable for production workloads. For production deployments, please consider our [Cloud](https://app.langwatch.ai) or [Enterprise On-Premises solution](#enterprise-on-premises-solution).

### Setup

At this moment, we are looking for feedback from our users on the docker-compose setup and understanding your use case.
