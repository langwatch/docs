<Note>
While the open-source version is available for local use and experimentation, for commercial use please reach out for a [demo call with our team](https://get.langwatch.ai/request-a-demo).
</Note>

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Running with Docker Compose

To run the project locally with Docker Compose, fetch the LangWatch repository and start the services:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langwatch/langwatch.git
cp langwatch/.env.example langwatch/.env
docker compose up -d --wait --build
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:5560](http://localhost:5560).

<Note>
 Curiosity: we decided on 5560 because that's where the letters "LLM" are, on a T9 keyboard.

## Helm Chart for LangWatch

LangWatch is available as a Helm chart for easy deployment on Kubernetes. The next section provides instructions for installing the Langwatch Helm chart.
