#  Observability for Mastra With LangWatch

This guide shows you how to integrate **Mastra** with **LangWatch** for observability and tracing. By following these steps, you'll be able to monitor and debug your Mastra agents in the LangWatch dashboard.


## Integration

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Mastra project">
Create a Mastra project using the Mastra CLI:

  ```bash
  npx create-mastra
  ```

  Move into the project directory:

  ```bash
  cd your-mastra-project
  ```
For more information, view Mastra installation instructions [here](https://mastra.ai/docs/getting-started/installation)


</Step>

<Step title="Set up LangWatch project">
Create a project in [LangWatch](https://app.langwatch.ai) and get your API keys from the project settings page.

</Step>

<Step title="Add environment variables">
  Create or update your `.env` file with the following variables:

  ```bash
  # Your LLM API key
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

  # LangWatch credentials
  LANGWATCH_API_KEY=sk-...

  ```
</Step>


<Step title="Install the langwatch package">
  Add the `langwatch` package to your project:

  ```bash
  npm install langwatch
  ```

</Step>

<Step title="Add LangWatch to your Mastra instance">
  Add LangWatch to your Mastra instance via the telemetry exporter. 

  ```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/loggers";
import { LibSQLStore } from "@mastra/libsql";
import { LangWatchExporter } from "langwatch";

import { weatherAgent } from "./agents/weather-agent";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { weatherAgent },
  telemetry: {
    serviceName: "ai", // this must be set to "ai" so that the LangWatchExporter thinks it's an AI SDK trace
    enabled: true,
    export: {
      type: "custom",
      exporter: new LangWatchExporter({
        apiKey: process.env.LANGWATCH_API_KEY,
        debug: true,
        // includeAllSpans: true,
      }),
    },
  },
});
  ```

</Step>


<Step title="Run mastra dev server">
  Start the Mastra development server:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  Head over to the developer playground with the provided URL and start chatting with your agent.
