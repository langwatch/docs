<Note>
Most agent frameworks automatically track tool calls for you. If you're using [OpenAI Agents, Agno, Mastra, or other supported frameworks](/integration/overview#frameworks), tool calls are already being captured automatically. You only need manual instrumentation for custom tools or unsupported frameworks.

## Manual Tool Tracking

If you have custom tools that aren't automatically tracked, you can manually instrument them using the `@langwatch.span(type="tool")` decorator:

```python
import langwatch
import os

langwatch.setup(api_key=os.getenv("LANGWATCH_API_KEY"))

@langwatch.trace()
def agent_call(query: str):
    # Your agent logic here
    result = my_custom_tool(query)
    return result

@langwatch.span(type="tool")
def my_custom_tool(query: str):
    # Your custom tool implementation
    result = f"Tool result for: {query}"
    return result

agent_call("What's the weather?")
```

This will display the tool call with a tool icon in the trace visualization and include it in tool call analytics in the LangWatch dashboard.
