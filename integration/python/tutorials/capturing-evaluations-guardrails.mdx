LangWatch provides a flexible system for capturing various types of evaluations and implementing guardrails within your LLM applications. This allows you to track performance, ensure quality, and control application flow based on defined criteria.

There are three main ways to work with evaluations and guardrails:

1.  **Client-Side Custom Evaluations (`add_evaluation`)**: Log any custom evaluation metric, human feedback, or external system score directly from your Python code. These are primarily for observational purposes.
2.  **Server-Side Managed Evaluations (`evaluate`, `async_evaluate`)**: Trigger predefined or custom evaluation logic that runs on the LangWatch backend. These can return scores, pass/fail results, and other details.
3.  **Guardrails**: A special application of evaluations (either client-side or server-side) used to make decisions or enforce policies within your application flow.

## 1. Client-Side Custom Evaluations (`add_evaluation`)

You can log custom evaluation data directly from your application code using the `add_evaluation()` method on a `LangWatchSpan` or `LangWatchTrace` object. This is useful for recording metrics specific to your domain, results from external systems, or human feedback.

When you call `add_evaluation()`, LangWatch typically creates a new child span of type `evaluation` (or `guardrail` if `is_guardrail=True`) under the target span. This child span, named after your custom evaluation, stores its details, primarily in its `output` attribute.

Here's an example:

```python
import langwatch

# Assume langwatch.setup() has been called

@langwatch.span(name="Generate Response")
def process_request(user_query: str):
    response_text = f"Response to: {user_query}"
    langwatch.get_current_span().update(output=response_text)

    # Example 1: A simple pass/fail custom evaluation
    contains_keyword = "LangWatch" in response_text
    langwatch.get_current_span().add_evaluation(
        name="Keyword Check: LangWatch",
        passed=contains_keyword,
        details=f"Checked for 'LangWatch'. Found: {contains_keyword}"
    )

    # Example 2: A custom score for response quality
    human_score = 4.5
    langwatch.get_current_span().add_evaluation(
        name="Human Review: Quality Score",
        score=human_score,
        label="Good",
        details="Reviewed by Jane Doe. Response is clear and relevant."
    )
    
    # Example 3: A client-side guardrail check
    is_safe = not ("unsafe_word" in response_text)
    langwatch.get_current_span().add_evaluation(
        name="Safety Check (Client-Side)",
        passed=is_safe,
        is_guardrail=True, # Mark this as a guardrail
        details=f"Content safety check. Passed: {is_safe}"
    )
    if not is_safe:
        # Potentially alter flow or log a critical warning
        print("Warning: Client-side safety check failed!")


    return response_text

@langwatch.trace(name="Process User Request")
def main():
    user_question = "Tell me about LangWatch."
    generated_response = process_request(user_question)
    print(f"Query: {user_question}")
    print(f"Response: {generated_response}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### `add_evaluation()` Parameters

The `add_evaluation()` method is available on both `LangWatchSpan` and `LangWatchTrace` objects (when using on a trace, you must specify the target `span`). For detailed parameter descriptions, please refer to the API reference:

- [`LangWatchSpan.add_evaluation()`](../reference.mdx#add_evaluation-1)
- [`LangWatchTrace.add_evaluation()`](../reference.mdx#add_evaluation)

## 2. Server-Side Managed Evaluations (`evaluate` & `async_evaluate`)

LangWatch allows you to trigger evaluations that are performed by the LangWatch backend. These can be built-in evaluators (e.g., for faithfulness, relevance) or custom evaluators you define in your LangWatch project settings.

You use the `evaluate()` (synchronous) or `async_evaluate()` (asynchronous) functions for this. These functions send the necessary data to the LangWatch API, which then processes the evaluation.

```python
import langwatch
from langwatch.evaluations import BasicEvaluateData
# from langwatch.types import RAGChunk # For RAG contexts

# Assume langwatch.setup() has been called

@langwatch.span()
def handle_rag_query(user_query: str):
    retrieved_contexts_str = [
        "LangWatch helps monitor LLM applications.",
        "Evaluations can be run on the server."
    ]
    # For richer context, use RAGChunk
    # retrieved_contexts_rag = [
    #     RAGChunk(content="LangWatch helps monitor LLM applications.", document_id="doc1"),
    #     RAGChunk(content="Evaluations can be run on the server.", document_id="doc2")
    # ]

    # Add the RAG contexts to the current span
    langwatch.get_current_span().update(contexts=retrieved_contexts_str)

    # Simulate LLM call
    llm_output = f"Based on the context, LangWatch is for monitoring and server-side evals."

    # Prepare data for server-side evaluation
    eval_data = BasicEvaluateData(
        input=user_query,
        output=llm_output,
        contexts=retrieved_contexts_str 
    )

    # Trigger a server-side "faithfulness" evaluation
    # The 'faithfulness-evaluator' slug must be configured in your LangWatch project
    try:
        faithfulness_result = langwatch.evaluate(
            slug="faithfulness-evaluator", # Slug of the evaluator in LangWatch
            name="Faithfulness Check (Server)",
            data=eval_data,
        )
        
        print(f"Faithfulness Evaluation Result: {faithfulness_result}")
        # faithfulness_result is an EvaluationResultModel(status, passed, score, details, etc.)

        # Example: Using it as a guardrail
        if faithfulness_result.passed is False:
            print("Warning: Faithfulness check failed!")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during server-side evaluation: {e}")

    return llm_output

@langwatch.trace()
def main():
    query = "What can LangWatch do with contexts?"
    response = handle_rag_query(query)
    print(f"Query: {query}")
    print(f"Response: {response}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### `evaluate()` / `async_evaluate()` Key Parameters

The `evaluate()` and `async_evaluate()` methods are available on both `LangWatchSpan` and `LangWatchTrace` objects. They can also be imported from `langwatch.evaluations` and called as `langwatch.evaluate()` or `langwatch.async_evaluate()`, where you would then explicitly pass the `span` or `trace` argument. For detailed parameter descriptions, refer to the API reference:

- [`LangWatchSpan.evaluate()`](../reference.mdx#evaluate-1) and [`LangWatchSpan.async_evaluate()`](../reference.mdx#async_evaluate-1)
- [`LangWatchTrace.evaluate()`](../reference.mdx#evaluate) and [`LangWatchTrace.async_evaluate()`](../reference.mdx#async_evaluate)

<Tip>
  **Understanding the `data` Parameter:**

  The core parameters like `slug`, `data`, `settings`, `as_guardrail`, `span`, and `trace` are generally consistent.
  For the `data` parameter specifically: while `BasicEvaluateData` is commonly used to provide a standardized structure for `input`, `output`, and `contexts` (which many built-in or common evaluators expect), it's important to know that `data` can be **any dictionary**. This flexibility allows you to pass arbitrary data structures tailored to custom server-side evaluators you might define.
</Tip>

The functions return an `EvaluationResultModel` containing `status`, `passed`, `score`, `details`, `label`, and `cost`.

## 3. Guardrails

Guardrails are evaluations used to make decisions or enforce policies within your application. They typically result in a boolean `passed` status that your code can act upon.

**Using Server-Side Evaluations as Guardrails:**
Set `as_guardrail=True` when calling `evaluate` or `async_evaluate`.

```python
# ... (inside a function with a current span)
eval_data = BasicEvaluateData(output=llm_response)
pii_check_result = langwatch.evaluate(
    slug="pii-detection-guardrail",
    data=eval_data,
    as_guardrail=True,
    span=langwatch.get_current_span()
)

if pii_check_result.passed is False:
    # Take action: sanitize response, return a canned message, etc.
    return "Response redacted due to PII."
```
A key behavior of `as_guardrail=True` for server-side evaluations is that if the *evaluation process itself* encounters an error (e.g., the evaluator service is down), the result will have `status="error"` but `passed` will default to `True`. This is a fail-safe to prevent your application from breaking due to an issue in the guardrail execution itself, assuming a "pass by default on error" stance is desired.

**Using Client-Side `add_evaluation` as Guardrails:**
Set `is_guardrail=True` when calling `add_evaluation`.

```python
# ... (inside a function with a current span)
is_too_long = len(llm_response) > 1000
response_span.add_evaluation(
    name="Length Guardrail",
    passed=(not is_too_long),
    is_guardrail=True,
    details=f"Length: {len(llm_response)}. Max: 1000"
)
if is_too_long:
    # Take action: truncate response, ask for shorter output, etc.
    return llm_response[:1000] + "..."
```
For client-side guardrails added with `add_evaluation`, your code is fully responsible for interpreting the `passed` status and handling any errors during the local check.

## How Evaluations and Guardrails Appear in LangWatch

Both client-side and server-side evaluations (including those marked as guardrails) are logged as spans in LangWatch.
- `add_evaluation`: Creates a child span of type `evaluation` (or `guardrail` if `is_guardrail=True`).
- `evaluate`/`async_evaluate`: Also create a child span of type `evaluation` (or `guardrail` if `as_guardrail=True`).

These spans will contain the evaluation's name, result (score, passed, label), details, cost, and any associated metadata, typically within their `output` attribute. This allows you to:
- See a history of all evaluation outcomes.
- Filter traces by evaluation results.
- Analyze the performance of different evaluators or guardrails.
- Correlate evaluation outcomes with other trace data (e.g., LLM inputs/outputs, latencies).

## Use Cases

- **Quality Assurance**:
    - **Client-Side**: Log scores from a custom heuristic checking for politeness in responses.
    - **Server-Side**: Trigger a managed "Toxicity" evaluator on LLM outputs.
- **Compliance & Safety**:
    - **Client-Side Guardrail**: Perform a regex check for forbidden words and log it with `is_guardrail=True`.
    - **Server-Side Guardrail**: Use a managed "PII Detection" evaluator with `as_guardrail=True` to decide if a response can be shown.
- **Performance Monitoring**:
    - **Client-Side**: Log human feedback scores (`add_evaluation`) for helpfulness.
    - **Server-Side**: Evaluate RAG system outputs for "Context Relevancy" and "Faithfulness" using managed evaluators.
- **A/B Testing**: Log custom metrics or trigger standard evaluations for different model versions or prompts to compare their performance.
- **Feedback Integration**: `add_evaluation` can be used to pipe scores from an external human review platform directly into the relevant trace.

By combining these methods, you can build a robust evaluation and guardrailing strategy tailored to your application's needs, all observable within LangWatch.
