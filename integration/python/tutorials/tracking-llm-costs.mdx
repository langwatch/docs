By default, LangWatch will automatically capture cost and token data for your LLM calls.

If you don't see costs being tracked or you see it being tracked as $0, this guide will help you identify and fix issues when cost and token tracking is not working as expected.

## Understanding Cost and Token Tracking

LangWatch calculates costs and tracks tokens by:

1. **Capturing model names** in LLM spans to match against cost tables
2. **Recording token metrics** (`prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`) in span data, or estimating when not available
3. **Mapping models to costs** using the pricing table in Settings > Model Costs

When any of these components are missing, you might see missing or $0 costs and tokens.

## Step 1: Verify LLM Span Data Capture

The most common issue is that your LLM spans aren't capturing the required data: model name, inputs, outputs, and token metrics.

### Check Your Current Spans

First, examine what data is being captured in your LLM spans. In the LangWatch dashboard:

1. Navigate to a trace that should have cost/token data
2. Click on the LLM span to inspect its details
3. Look for these key fields:
   - **Model**: Should show the model identifier (e.g., `openai/gpt-5`)
   - **Input/Output**: Should contain the actual messages sent and received
   - **Metrics**: Should show prompt + completion tokens

## Step 2: Fix Missing Model Information

If your spans don't show model information, the integration framework you're using might not be capturing it automatically.

### Solution A: Use Framework Auto-tracking

LangWatch provides auto-tracking for popular frameworks that automatically captures all the necessary data for cost calculation.

Check the **Integrations** menu in the sidebar to find specific setup instructions for your framework, which will show you how to properly configure automatic model and token tracking.

### Solution B: Manually Set Model Information

If auto-tracking isn't available for your framework, manually update the span with model information:

```python
import langwatch

# Mark the span as an LLM type span
@langwatch.span(type="llm")
def custom_llm_call(prompt: str):
    # Update the current span with model information
    langwatch.get_current_span().update(
        model="openai/gpt-5",  # Use the exact model identifier
        input=prompt,
    )

    # Simulate an LLM response
    response = your_custom_llm_client.generate(prompt)

    # Update with output and metrics
    langwatch.get_current_span().update(
        output=response.text,
        metrics={
            "prompt_tokens": response.usage.prompt_tokens,
            "completion_tokens": response.usage.completion_tokens,
        }
    )

    return response.text

@langwatch.trace()
def main_handler():
    result = custom_llm_call("Tell me about LangWatch")
    return result
```

### Solution C: Direct OpenTelemetry Integration (without LangWatch SDK)

If you're using a framework with built-in OpenTelemetry integration or community instrumentors, they should be following the [GenAI Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans/). However, if the integration isn't capturing model information or token counts correctly, you can wrap your LLM calls with a custom span to patch the missing data:

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def my_llm_call_with_tracking(prompt):
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("llm_call_wrapper") as span:
        # Set the required attributes for cost calculation
        span.set_attribute("gen_ai.operation.name", "chat")
        span.set_attribute("gen_ai.request.model", "gpt-5")

        # Your existing LLM call (may create its own spans)
        response = your_framework_llm_client.generate(prompt)

        # Extract and set token information if available
        if hasattr(response, 'usage'):
            span.set_attribute("gen_ai.usage.input_tokens", response.usage.input_tokens)
            span.set_attribute("gen_ai.usage.completion_tokens", response.usage.completion_tokens)

        return response
```

## Step 3: Configure Model Cost Mapping

If your model information is being captured but costs still show $0, you need to configure the cost mapping.

### Check Existing Model Costs

1. Go to **Settings > Model Costs** in your LangWatch dashboard
2. Look for your model in the list
3. Check if the regex pattern matches your model identifier

  alt="Model Costs settings page showing cost configuration"
/>

### Add Custom Model Costs

If your model isn't in the cost table, add it:

1. Click **"Add New Model"** in Settings > Model Costs
2. Configure the model entry:
   - **Model Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "gpt-5")
   - **Regex Match Rule**: Pattern to match your model identifier (e.g., `^gpt-5$`)
   - **Input Cost**: Cost per input token (e.g., `0.0000004`)
   - **Output Cost**: Cost per output token (e.g., `0.0000016`)

### Common Model Identifier Patterns

Make sure your regex patterns match how the model names appear in your spans:

| Framework    | Model Identifier Format | Regex Pattern          |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| OpenAI SDK   | `gpt-5`           | `^gpt-5$`        |
| Azure OpenAI | `gpt-5`           | `^gpt-5$`        |
| LangChain    | `openai/gpt-5`    | `^openai/gpt-5$` |
| Custom       | `my-custom-model-v1`    | `^my-custom-model-v1$` |


### Verification Checklist

After running your test, verify in the LangWatch dashboard:

✅ **Trace appears** in the dashboard \
✅ **LLM span shows model name** (e.g., `gpt-5`) \
✅ **Input and output are captured** \
✅ **Token metrics are present** (`prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`) \
✅ **Cost is calculated and displayed** (non-zero value)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Auto-tracking not working

**Symptoms**: Spans appear but without model/metrics data

**Solutions**:

- Ensure `autotrack_*()` is called on an active trace
- Check that the client instance being tracked is the same one making calls
- Verify the integration is initialized correctly

### Issue: Custom models not calculating costs

**Symptoms**: Model name appears but cost remains $0

**Solutions**:

- Check regex pattern in Model Costs settings
- Ensure the pattern exactly matches your model identifier
- Verify input and output costs are configured correctly

### Issue: Token counts are 0 but model is captured

**Symptoms**: Model name is present but token metrics are missing

**Solutions**:

- Manually set metrics in span updates if not automatically captured
- Check if your LLM provider returns usage information
- Ensure the integration is extracting token counts from responses

### Issue: Framework with OpenTelemetry not capturing model data

**Symptoms**: Using a framework with OpenTelemetry integration that's not capturing model names or token counts

**Solutions**:
- Follow the guidance in [Solution C: Framework with OpenTelemetry Integration](#solution-c-framework-with-opentelemetry-integration) above
- Wrap your LLM calls with custom spans to patch missing data


## Getting Help

If you're still experiencing issues after following this guide:

1. **Check the LangWatch logs** for any error messages
2. **Verify your API key** and endpoint configuration
3. **Share a minimal reproduction** with the specific framework you're using
4. **Contact support** at [support@langwatch.ai](mailto:support@langwatch.ai) with:
   - Your integration method (SDK, OpenTelemetry, etc.)
   - Framework versions
   - Sample span data from the dashboard

Cost and token tracking should work reliably once the model information and metrics are properly captured. Most issues stem from missing model identifiers or incorrect cost table configuration.
