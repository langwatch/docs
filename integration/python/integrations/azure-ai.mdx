The `azure-ai-inference` Python SDK provides a unified way to interact with various AI models deployed on Azure, including those on Azure OpenAI Service, GitHub Models, and Azure AI Foundry Serverless/Managed Compute endpoints. For more details on the SDK, refer to the [official Azure AI Inference client library documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ai-inference-readme?view=azure-python-preview).

LangWatch can capture traces generated by the `azure-ai-inference` SDK by leveraging its built-in OpenTelemetry support. This guide will show you how to set it up.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Install LangWatch SDK**:
    ```bash
    pip install langwatch
    ```

2.  **Install Azure AI Inference SDK with OpenTelemetry support**:
    The `azure-ai-inference` SDK can be installed with OpenTelemetry capabilities. You might also need the core Azure OpenTelemetry tracing package.
    ```bash
    pip install azure-ai-inference[opentelemetry] azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry
    ```
    Refer to the [Azure SDK documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ai-inference-readme?view=azure-python-preview#install-the-package) for the most up-to-date installation instructions.

## Instrumentation with `AIInferenceInstrumentor`

The `azure-ai-inference` SDK provides an `AIInferenceInstrumentor` that automatically captures traces for its operations when enabled. LangWatch, when set up, will include an OpenTelemetry exporter that can collect these traces.

Here's how to instrument your application:

```python
import langwatch
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.tracing import AIInferenceInstrumentor
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
import os
import asyncio

# 1. Initialize LangWatch
langwatch.setup(
    instrumentors=[AIInferenceInstrumentor()]
)

# 2. Configure your Azure AI Inference client
azure_openai_endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT")
azure_openai_api_key = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY")
azure_openai_api_version = "2024-06-01"

chat_client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=azure_openai_endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(azure_openai_api_key),
    api_version=azure_openai_api_version
)

@langwatch.trace(name="Azure AI Inference Chat")
async def get_ai_response(prompt: str):
    # This call will now be automatically traced by the AIInferenceInstrumentor and
    # captured by LangWatch as a span within the "Azure AI Inference Chat" trace.
    response = await chat_client.complete(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

async def main():
    user_prompt = "What is the Azure AI Inference SDK?"

    try:
        ai_reply = await get_ai_response(user_prompt)
        print(f"User: {user_prompt}")
        print(f"AI: {ai_reply}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

<Note>
The example uses the synchronous `ChatCompletionsClient` for simplicity in demonstrating instrumentation. The `azure-ai-inference` SDK also provides asynchronous clients under the `azure.ai.inference.aio` namespace (e.g., `azure.ai.inference.aio.ChatCompletionsClient`). If you are using `async/await` in your application, you should use these asynchronous clients. The `AIInferenceInstrumentor` will work with both synchronous and asynchronous clients.
</Note>

## How it Works

1.  `langwatch.setup()`: Initializes the LangWatch SDK, which includes setting up an OpenTelemetry trace exporter. This exporter is ready to receive spans from any OpenTelemetry-instrumented library in your application.
2.  `AIInferenceInstrumentor().instrument()`: This command, provided by the `azure-ai-inference` SDK, patches the relevant Azure AI clients (like `ChatCompletionsClient` or `EmbeddingsClient`) to automatically create OpenTelemetry spans for their operations (e.g., a `complete` or `embed` call).
3.  `@langwatch.trace()`: By decorating your own functions (like `get_ai_response` in the example), you create a parent trace in LangWatch. The spans automatically generated by the `AIInferenceInstrumentor` for calls made within this decorated function will then be nested under this parent trace. This provides a full end-to-end view of your operation.

With this setup, calls made using the `azure-ai-inference` clients will be automatically traced and sent to LangWatch, providing visibility into the performance and behavior of your AI model interactions.
