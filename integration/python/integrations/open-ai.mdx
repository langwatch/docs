LangWatch offers robust integration with OpenAI, allowing you to capture detailed information about your LLM calls automatically. There are two primary approaches to instrumenting your OpenAI interactions:

1.  **Using `autotrack_openai_calls()`**: This method, part of the LangWatch SDK, dynamically patches your OpenAI client instance to capture calls made through it within a specific trace.
2.  **Using Community OpenTelemetry Instrumentors**: Leverage existing OpenTelemetry instrumentation libraries like those from OpenInference or OpenLLMetry. These can be integrated with LangWatch by either passing them to the `langwatch.setup()` function or by using their native `instrument()` methods if you're managing your OpenTelemetry setup more directly.

This guide will walk you through both methods.

## Using `autotrack_openai_calls()`

The `autotrack_openai_calls()` function provides a straightforward way to capture all OpenAI calls made with a specific client instance for the duration of the current trace.

You typically call this method on the trace object obtained via `langwatch.get_current_trace()` inside a function decorated with `@langwatch.trace()`.

```python
import langwatch
from openai import OpenAI

# Ensure LANGWATCH_API_KEY is set in your environment, or set it in `setup`
langwatch.setup()

# Initialize your OpenAI client
client = OpenAI()

@langwatch.trace(name="OpenAI Chat Completion")
async def get_openai_chat_response(user_prompt: str):
    # Get the current trace and enable autotracking for the 'client' instance
    langwatch.get_current_trace().autotrack_openai_calls(client)

    # All calls made with 'client' will now be automatically captured as spans
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}],
    )
    completion = response.choices[0].message.content
    return completion

async def main():
    user_query = "Tell me a joke about Python programming."
    response = await get_openai_chat_response(user_query)
    print(f"User: {user_query}")
    print(f"AI: {response}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Key points for `autotrack_openai_calls()`:
-   It must be called on an active trace object (e.g., obtained via `langwatch.get_current_trace()`).
-   It instruments a *specific instance* of the OpenAI client. If you have multiple clients, you'll need to call it for each one you want to track.

## Using Community OpenTelemetry Instrumentors

If you prefer to use broader OpenTelemetry-based instrumentation, or are already using libraries like `OpenInference` or `OpenLLMetry`, LangWatch can seamlessly integrate with them. These libraries provide instrumentors that automatically capture data from various LLM providers, including OpenAI.

There are two main ways to integrate these:

### 1. Via `langwatch.setup()`

You can pass an instance of the instrumentor (e.g., `OpenAIInstrumentor` from OpenInference or OpenLLMetry) to the `instrumentors` list in the `langwatch.setup()` call. LangWatch will then manage the lifecycle of this instrumentor.

```python
import langwatch
from openai import OpenAI
import os

# Example using OpenInference's OpenAIInstrumentor
from openinference.instrumentation.openai import OpenAIInstrumentor

# Initialize LangWatch with the OpenAIInstrumentor
langwatch.setup(
    instrumentors=[OpenAIInstrumentor()]
)

client = OpenAI()

@langwatch.trace(name="OpenAI Call with Community Instrumentor")
def generate_text_with_community_instrumentor(prompt: str):
    # No need to call autotrack explicitly, the community instrumentor handles OpenAI calls globally.
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_query = "Tell me a joke about Python programming."
    response = generate_text_with_community_instrumentor(user_query)
    print(f"User: {user_query}")
    print(f"AI: {response}")
```
<Note>
  Ensure you have the respective community instrumentation library installed (e.g., `pip install openllmetry-instrumentation-openai` or `pip install openinference-instrumentation-openai`).
</Note>

### 2. Direct Instrumentation

If you have an existing OpenTelemetry `TracerProvider` configured in your application (or if LangWatch is configured to use the global provider), you can use the community instrumentor's `instrument()` method directly. LangWatch will automatically pick up the spans generated by these instrumentors as long as its exporter is part of the active `TracerProvider`.

```python
import langwatch
from openai import OpenAI
import os
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor, ConsoleSpanExporter

from openinference.instrumentation.openai import OpenAIInstrumentor

langwatch.setup()
client = OpenAI()

# Instrument OpenAI directly using the community library
OpenAIInstrumentor().instrument()

@langwatch.trace(name="OpenAI Call with Direct Community Instrumentation")
def get_story_ending(beginning: str):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a creative writer. Complete the story."},
            {"role": "user", "content": beginning}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

if __name__ == "__main__":
    story_start = "In a land of dragons and wizards, a young apprentice found a mysterious map..."
    ending = get_story_ending(story_start)
    print(f"Story Start: {story_start}")
    print(f"AI's Ending: {ending}")
```

### Key points for community instrumentors:
-   These instrumentors often patch OpenAI at a global level, meaning all OpenAI calls from any client instance will be captured once instrumented.
-   If using `langwatch.setup(instrumentors=[...])`, LangWatch handles the setup.
-   If instrumenting directly (e.g., `OpenAIInstrumentor().instrument()`), ensure that the `TracerProvider` used by the instrumentor is the same one LangWatch is exporting from. This usually means LangWatch is configured to use an existing global provider or one you explicitly pass to `langwatch.setup()`.

<Note>
### Which Approach to Choose?

-   **`autotrack_openai_calls()`** is ideal for targeted instrumentation within specific traces or when you want fine-grained control over which OpenAI client instances are tracked. It's simpler if you're not deeply invested in a separate OpenTelemetry setup.
-   **Community Instrumentors** are powerful if you're already using OpenTelemetry, want to capture OpenAI calls globally across your application, or need to instrument other libraries alongside OpenAI with a consistent OpenTelemetry approach. They provide a more holistic observability solution if you have multiple OpenTelemetry-instrumented components.

Choose the method that best fits your existing setup and instrumentation needs. Both approaches effectively send OpenAI call data to LangWatch for monitoring and analysis.
