title: "RAG Context Tracking"
description: Capture the RAG documents used in your LLM pipelines
---

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAGs) is a common way to augment the generation of your LLM by retrieving a set of documents based on the user query and giving it to the LLM to use as context for answering, either by using a vector database, getting responses from an API, or integrated agent files and memory.

It can be challenging, however, to build a good quality RAG pipeline, making sure the right data was retrieved, preventing the LLM from hallucinating, monitor which documents are the most used and keep iterating to improve it, this is where integrating with LangWatch can help, by integrating your RAG you unlock a series of Guardrails, Measurements and Analytics for RAGs LangWatch.

To track the RAG context when using the REST API, add a new span of type `rag`, you may also refer the LLM generation as the child of it:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://app.langwatch.ai/api/collector" \\
     -H "X-Auth-Token: $API_KEY" \\
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
